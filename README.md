## Installation
Follow these steps to set up the project locally.

### Prerequisites
- Node.js and npm installed on your machine
- Python 3.8 + and flask installed for running server
- Other dependencies specified in the Pipfile

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   
   git clone https://github.com/IannitoTechbros/PHASE-5-GROUP-PROJECT---IAN---ERICK---MARTIN---FELIX---JEREMIAH.git
   cd PHASE-5-GROUP-PROJECT---IAN---ERICK---MARTIN---FELIX---JEREMIAH

2. Navigate to the frontend directory and install dependencies:
    cd frontend
    npm install

3. Navigate to the backend directory and set up the Flask environment in another terminal:
   cd backend
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   flask run

4. Start the frontend development server:
   cd frontend
   npm start

## Challenges

1. Git Branches and Merge Conflicts
   We encountered several merge conflicts while integrating various branches. To resolve these conflicts, we carefully reviewed the conflicting files, discussed changes with team members, and manually merged the code.

2. Compatibility with Packages and Dependencies
   We faced compatibility issues with some packages and dependencies. We resolved these by updating the package versions or finding alternative packages that worked well with our project.

3. Debugging and Testing
   Debugging and testing were challenging due to the complexity of the project and the various components involved. We spent significant time on unit testing and debugging to ensure the application worked as expected.

4. Handling Large Files and Data
   We encountered issues with handling large files and data, which affected the performance of the application. We optimized the code and implemented pagination to improve the application's performance.

5. Integration of Frontend and Backend
   Integrating the frontend and backend was a complex task. We carefully designed the API endpoints and implemented the necessary communication between the frontend and backend to ensure seamless interaction.

6. Deployment and Hosting
   Deploying and hosting the application on a cloud platform was a challenge. We carefully configured the server and deployed the application to ensure it was accessible to users.

7. User Authentication and Authorization
   Implementing user authentication and authorization was a critical aspect of the project. We carefully designed the authentication flow and implemented the necessary security measures to protect user data.

8. Responsive Design and User Experience
   Ensuring a responsive design and providing an excellent user experience was a priority. We carefully designed the user interface and implemented responsive design principles to ensure the application was accessible on various devices.

9. Testing and Quality Assurance
   Testing and quality assurance were crucial to ensure the application worked as expected. We implemented unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests to ensure the application was reliable and free of bugs.

10. Documentation and Maintenance
    Providing comprehensive documentation and maintaining the application was essential. We carefully documented the code and provided clear instructions for users and developers to ensure the application could be easily maintained and updated.

## Usage
Once the project is installed, you can use it as follows:

1. Open the frontend in your web browser.
2. Interact with the application as per the provided instructions.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into the following directories:

- frontend: Contains the frontend code for the application.
- backend: Contains the backend code for the application.
